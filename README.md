<h1>DeepCells</h1>

- DeepCells is an easy to use Python framework for training deep learning models using data generated from high content cellular microscopy images.
- The main advantages of using this package is that it is able to automate the analysis design process as well as scale to very large datasets.
- There are three main .py files that encode the functionality to train a given deep learning model to classify cellular images. They also allow the user to perform inference eon a trained model.
- A sample deep learning model file that inherits from TF_model is also provided under the models directory.

DeepCells was originally created by Yusuf Roohani while working at GlaxoSmithKline LLC
